# SuperKeysJS

SuperKeysJS gives users of your application the ability to insert commonly used special keys into browser input fields.

# Huh?

Type normally into the browser. When you get to where you need to insert a special character like a 'Ã¼' for example, hold down the 'u' key until you see char options pop up.

Use the left or right arrow keys to highlight the desired character and hit enter to insert the character into the input field text.

Or you can use the number keys to insert as a shortcut.

# Ohhh... How do I add it?

Clone or download this repo. Add superKeys.js to your project and it should take care of itself.

# Dependencies

One. The project is 100% pure JS but does rely on the project mentioned below. It is already included in superKeys.js so there is nothing to add to your project beyond that.

# A special thanks

This project makes use of the text-caret-position project which is an awesome hack that finds the caret position. You should check out this repo - https://github.com/component/textarea-caret-position

Thanks to those who have contributed to that project.
